# Exercise 4 - Create an Interpreter from output of Syntax Analyzer

Assuming your output is a list of tokens arranged in a tree structure coming from your Syntax Analyzer,
create an interpreter to execute the code.

Date of Submission/presentation: May 16 - 20

Your code must go through all parts from Exercise 2 to 4.

To get full points, you have to run these problems:

1.	Simple print out of Hello World on console
2.	Input a number from keyboard and output a print out of numbers in console from 1 to your number if number is positive and -1 down to your number if number is negative. If number is 0, just print out 0…
3.	Input a text file with a sequence of numbers per line, then output a file with the same sequence of numbers but sorted ascendingly
4.	Input a number from keyboard and output a print out of numbers in console a Fibonacci sequence with the keyed-in number as the number of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
```
a.	E.g. 7
1 2 3 5 8 13 21
```
5.	Input a number from 1-20, then ask the person to ask several numbers, based on the number that the user input. Then the numbers must be sorted into two sets, one in ascending order and one in descending order. The two orders must then be printed on console. Then the ascending ordered numbers must be added to the descending ordered numbers and also printed on console. Then the ascending ordered numbers must be multiplied with the descending ordered numbers and then also printed on console.
```
a.	E.g, 5
1
6
2
3
7
1 2 3 6 7
7 6 3 2 1
8 8 6 8 8
7 12 9 12 7
```
6.	Check if the input string is a palindrome. If it is, print out true. If it is not, print out false
7.	Given a string name, Print a text file using the string as the filename and print the documentation on how to code using your language on that file
8.	Print 50 random numbers from -10,000 to 10,000 and then print the summation of its numbers, the summation of its negative counterparts (if the original number is 5, then add -5… and vice-versa), the average of the numbers and the standard deviation of the numbers
