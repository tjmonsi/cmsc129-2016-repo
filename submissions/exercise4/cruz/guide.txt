Note: Parentheses aren't implemented yet for grouping.

Variable Declaration Variable declaration can be done by using the following sequence: var [varname] = [expression].

Variable Assignment Variable assignment can be done by using the following sequence: [varname] = [expression]. The variable should already be existing before it can be set.

Printing Printing can be done by calling the "print([expression])" function. The parameters will be printed as string sequence.

Function Calls Function calling can be done by simply using the function as long as it exists.

Computation Using operations +, -, *, /, and % in numbers works fine. Can be used in variable declaration and assignments.
	However, this does not follow the MDAS rule.

To convert number to string, use ""+[number];

To convert string to number, use num([string]);

If Statement If statement must be called exactly as: if([expression]){[code-block]}else{[code-block]}.
	The conditional statements will only accept value 1 of type num as true.

While Loop While loop must be called with brackets. while([expression]){[code-block]}
